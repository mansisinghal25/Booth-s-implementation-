# Booths-implementation

Booth’s algorithm is a multiplication algorithm that multiplies two signed binary integers. In my implementation two integers are taken as input and then the corresponding result after every cycle in the booth’s algorithm are printed. Finally the answer in binary and it’s decimal conversion is also printed.

ASSUMPTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS:
•	Two integers are to be supplied as input.
•	No floating point numbers are supplied.
•	Register bit has been taken as a variable so it’s value becomes one more than the number bits of the larger number out of the multiplicand and multiplier.
•	The first number supplied is the multiplicand and the second one is multiplier.
•	Since the number of bits is a variable, the maximum number for which this code works will be the maximum integer input that python can take.
